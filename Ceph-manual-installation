# Manual install of a Ceph Cluster.

### Fetching software.

First of we want to check that I have all the latest packages in my debian system.
```
apt update
apt upgrade
```

Next we fetch the keys and ceph packages, in this case we download the pacific packages for buster.
```
wget -q -O- 'https://download.ceph.com/keys/release.asc' | sudo apt-key add -
echo deb https://download.ceph.com/debian-pacific/ buster main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list
apt update
apt install ceph ceph-common
```

### Configure node 1

First we will create a ceph configuration file.
```
sudo vi /etc/ceph/ceph.conf
```

The most important things to specify is the id and ips of the cluster monitors. A unique cluster id that you will reuse for all  nodes. And lastly a public network range that we want the monitors to be available over. The cluster network is a good addition because we want the resources to route the recovery traffic on a backbone network.
```
[global]
fsid = 6542b068-0063-11ee-be56-0242ac120002
mon initial members = server1, server2, server3
mon host = 192.168.10.10, 192.168.10.20, 192.168.10.30
public network = 192.168.10.0/24
cluster network = 10.0.0.0/24
auth cluster required = cephx
auth service required = cephx
auth client required = cephx
```

Next we create keys for admin, monitors and boostrapping our drives. These keys will then be merged with the monitor key so the initial setup will have the keys used for other operations.
```
sudo ceph-authtool --create-keyring /tmp/monkey --gen-key -n mon. --cap mon 'allow *'
sudo ceph-authtool --create-keyring /etc/ceph/ceph.client.admin.keyring --gen-key -n client.admin --cap mon 'allow *' --cap osd 'allow *' --cap mds 'allow *' --cap mgr 'allow *'
sudo ceph-authtool --create-keyring /var/lib/ceph/bootstrap-osd/ceph.keyring --gen-key -n client.bootstrap-osd --cap mon 'profile bootstrap-osd'
sudo ceph-authtool /tmp/monkey --import-keyring /etc/ceph/ceph.client.admin.keyring
sudo ceph-authtool /tmp/monkey --import-keyring /var/lib/ceph/bootstrap-osd/ceph.keyring
```

Make the monitor key available to the ceph user so we don't get an permission error when we start our services.
```
sudo chown ceph:ceph /tmp/monkey
```

Next up we create a monitor map so the monitors will know of each other. The monitors keeps track on other resources but for high availability the monitors needs to know who is in charge.
```
monmaptool --create --add server1 192.168.10.10 --fsid {cluster uuid} /tmp/monmap
monmaptool --add server2 192.168.10.20 --fsid {cluster uuid} /tmp/monmap
monmaptool --add server3 192.168.10.30 --fsid {cluster uuid} /tmp/monmap
```

Starting a new monitor is as easy as creating a new directory, creating the filesystem for and starting the service.
```
sudo -u ceph mkdir /var/lib/ceph/mon/ceph-{node1-id}
sudo -u ceph ceph-mon --mkfs -i server1 --monmap /tmp/monmap --keyring /tmp/monkey
sudo systemctl start ceph-mon@server1
```

Next up we need a manager so we could configure and monitor our cluster through a visual dashboard. First we create a new key, put that key in a newly created directory and start the service. Enabling a dashboard is as easy as running the command for enabling, creating / assigning a certificate and creating a new admin user.
```
sudo ceph auth get-or-create mgr.server1 mon 'allow profile mgr' osd 'allow *' mds 'allow *'
sudo -u ceph mkdir /var/lib/ceph/mgr/ceph-server1
sudo -u ceph vi /var/lib/ceph/mgr/ceph-server1/keyring
sudo systemctl start ceph-mgr@server1
sudo ceph mgr module enable dashboard
sudo ceph dashboard create-self-signed-cert
sudo ceph dashboard ac-user-create admin -i passwd administrator
```

### Setting up more nodes (server2 and server3).

First of we need to copy over the configuration, monitor map and all the keys over to our new host.
```
sudo scp user@server1:/etc/ceph/ceph.conf /etc/ceph/ceph.conf
sudo scp user@server1:/etc/ceph/ceph.client.admin.keyring /etc/ceph/ceph.client.admin.keyring
sudo scp user@server1:/var/lib/ceph/bootstrap-osd/ceph.keyring /var/lib/ceph/bootstrap-osd/ceph.keyring
sudo scp user@server1:/tmp/monmap /tmp/monmap
sudo scp user@server1:/tmp/monkey /tmp/monkey
```

Next up we setup the monitor node exactly as we did with the first node.
```
sudo -u ceph mkdir /var/lib/ceph/mon/ceph-server"(2-3)"
sudo -u ceph ceph-mon --mkfs -i server"(2-3)" --monmap /tmp/monmap --keyring /tmp/monkey
sudo systemctl start ceph-mon@server"(2-3)"
sudo ceph -s
sudo ceph mon enable-msgr2
```

Then we setup the manager node exactly as we did with the first node on server3.
```
sudo ceph auth get-or-create mgr.server3 mon 'allow profile mgr' osd 'allow *' mds 'allow *'
sudo -u ceph mkdir /var/lib/ceph/mgr/ceph-server3
sudo -u ceph vi /var/lib/ceph/mgr/ceph-server3/keyring
sudo systemctl start ceph-mgr@server3
```

### Adding storage

When the cluster is up and running and all monitors are in qourum you could add storage services. This is easily done via the volume command. First prepare all disks so it will be known by the cluster and have the keys and configuration copied to the management directory. Next up we activate the service so your storage nodes will be ready to use. This will be done for all the harddrives you want to add to your network.
```
sudo ceph-volume lvm prepare --data /dev/sd"(b-c and d)" 
sudo ceph-volume lvm activate {osd-number"(from 1 to 9)"} {osd-uuid}
```

### Post configuration

Last but not least you want to ensure that all the services starts after a reboot. In debian you do that by enabling the services.
```
sudo systemctl enable ceph-mon@"(server1,server2,server3)"
sudo systemctl enable ceph-mgr@"(server1,server2,server3)"
sudo systemctl enable ceph-osd@"(from 1 to 9)"
```
